Dear Prof. Zhou,

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits. I would like to provide you with an update on my progress over the past two weeks:

[body part]

I would like to seek your advice on whether I should prioritize deployment or continue focusing on reading papers. I anticipate this discussion may take around 15 minutes. Could you please let me know your availability this week for a brief meeting?

Thank you for your guidance and support. I look forward to your valuable feedback.

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!

**Achievements:**

1. Successfully configured the Gymnasium environment from OpenAI and completed several testing examples on Linux.
2. Finished watching Yang Song's talk and gathered some basic information from Wikipedia, gaining a preliminary understanding of score models. I have written a brief summary, which is available [here](https://github.com/randulfzhao/DiffusionModel/blob/main/Review/Summary%20for%20YANG%20SONG's%20work.md).
3. Finished reading two papers on using diffusion models for planning. One paper, _Conditional Generative Modeling for Diffusion Models_, is summarized [here](https://github.com/randulfzhao/DiffusionModel/blob/main/Review/Literature%20Review/IS%20CONDITIONAL%20GENERATIVE%20MODELING%20ALL%20YOU%20NEED%20FOR%20DECISION-MAKING%20(CPDD).md). The other paper is pending summary.

**Next Steps:**

1. Complete the summary for the second paper on diffusion models for planning.
2. Explore more papers on diffusion models, focusing on Yang Song work's track or delving into U-Net or classifier-free methods to further understand the pipeline of decision making in diffusion models.
3. Deploy and evaluate the _Conditional Generative Modeling for Diffusion Models_ framework.
